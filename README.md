This work focuses on incorporating D2D communications in SAGIN for ensuring reliability via Reinforcement Learning (RL) based on Markov process. We derive the optimal numbers of transmitting nodes used for communication links, represent the Markov State transition and provide the Bellman equation for our model. The main objective is to maximize Energy Efficiency (EE), under the limitations of Spectral Efficiency (SE). Performance evaluations are employed to assess reliability over the links in the corresponding proposed architecture. The simulation results with water-filling optimization show that the proposed model achieves enhanced EE and SE per D2D link.
